# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Graph Traversal System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create graph traversal functionality for finding related concepts and building knowledge paths
# Details:
Implement algorithms to traverse the graph collection and find related concepts, build knowledge paths, and discover connections between different nodes. This will enable more sophisticated querying and knowledge discovery.

# Test Strategy:
Test traversal algorithms with various starting nodes and verify correct path discovery
